# Workspace Instructions

## Validation Expectations
- After every code change, run a local verification pass against the locally retrieved API-backed data already available
  in the workspace or `.env`-driven provider flow.
- Do not stop at lint, typecheck, or unit tests when a change affects lookup, routes, rendered civic content, or page
  wiring. Confirm that each affected route and system actually populates and connects to the correct data in the local
  runtime.

## Lockfiles, Commits, Tags, And Releases
- Do not leave completed work uncommitted. After each coherent, validated change set, create a commit and push it in the same session.
- Use multiple commits and pushes when that keeps unrelated changes, partial validations, or follow-up fixes clearly separated. Prefer small, logically grouped commits over one mixed commit.
- Keep both `package-lock.json` and `back-end/package-lock.json` synchronized before every commit or push.
- Use lowercase annotated semver tags only. Do not invent ad-hoc labels such as `V1`, `torca-r07`, `pre-lfs-migration-*`, or similar one-off names.
- This repo follows the stable `v1.x` line. Stay on `v1` for routine work; only cut `v2` for an intentional breaking product, API-contract, or deployment change.
- Before creating a new tag, check the latest tag in the active semver line and decide whether the new commit is still the same release milestone. If it is, move that existing tag forward to the new validated commit instead of minting a new version number.
- Keep the GitHub release aligned with that decision: when the commit still belongs to the same milestone, update or recreate the existing release so it points at the moved tag/current commit; only create a brand-new release when the change creates a genuinely new milestone.
- Cut a fresh semver tag and release only when the work crosses a real release boundary, such as a new deployable milestone, a materially different operator/user-facing state, or a version-line change that deserves its own notes and rollback point.
- Create an annotated tag when ballot lookup behavior, candidate/measure/election content, API contracts, dependency/security posture, or health/deploy behavior materially changes.
- Create a GitHub release when that tag represents a real production milestone for voters, operators, or rollback/reference needs. Release notes should summarize scope, validation, rollout notes, and any migration or recovery steps.
- If the existing tag or release history contains stale drafts, redundant entries, or ad-hoc labels, clean that history up instead of preserving clutter.
- Skip tags and releases for trivial doc-only edits, formatting-only changes, or routine housekeeping unless they change deployment, operations, or a consumer-facing contract.

## Dependency & Lockfile Discipline

- Treat the repo-root `npm ci` path as the source of truth for deploy readiness.
- Any time `package.json`, any workspace `package.json`, dependency ranges, `package-lock.json`, or dependency update tooling changes, verify lockfile parity from the repo root before committing.
- Do not rely on `npm install` fallback as success. A change is not deploy-ready unless root `npm ci` succeeds.

Required dependency verification before every commit/push:
1. Run `npm ci` from the repository root.
2. Run `npm run lint`.
3. Run `npm run typecheck`.
4. Run `npm run build`.
5. If API or back-end behavior changed and the repo has a back-end workspace, run `npm run -w back-end test` or the repo's equivalent API test command.

If `npm ci` fails because `package.json` and `package-lock.json` are out of sync:
1. Run `npm install --package-lock-only --ignore-scripts --no-fund --no-audit` from the repository root.
2. Re-run `npm ci` from the repository root.
3. Commit the resulting `package-lock.json` change with the related dependency/package change.

Never commit or push dependency/package changes if root `npm ci` fails.
